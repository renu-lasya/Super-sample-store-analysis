# Super-sample-store-analysis
This project is based on data analytics using the Sample Superstore dataset. The main objective of this work was to perform data cleaning, processing, and visualization to derive meaningful insights and understand how data can be managed efficiently.

We carried out the project using IBM Cloud tools, which provided an interactive environment to handle large datasets and explore different aspects of data management. The process began with data cleaning, where we removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and standardized the dataset. This step ensured that the data was accurate, reliable, and ready for analysis.

Next, we moved to data sorting and structuring. We learned how raw data could be organized and categorized to make it more useful for decision-making. This included sorting by region, category, sub-category, and sales performance. These steps helped us understand the importance of proper data organization in analytics projects.

The final stage was data visualization, where we created meaningful charts and graphs to represent sales performance, profits, and customer segments. Visualization played a key role in interpreting the results, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement. Using IBM Cloud services, we also experienced how cloud-based platforms simplify the process of data analytics and make it accessible from anywhere.

Through this project, we gained practical knowledge of how data analytics works in real-world scenarios. We learned the importance of data cleaning, sorting, and visualization in driving insights. Overall, this project not only improved our technical skills but also helped us understand the business significance of managing data effectively.

This repository contains the dataset, cleaning steps, and visualizations created during the project. It can be used as a reference for beginners in data analytics to practice and understand the workflow of a complete analytics project.
